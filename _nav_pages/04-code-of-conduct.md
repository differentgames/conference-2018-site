# Maintaining a Respectful and Accountable Space

I understand that by entering into the grounds of the Different Games Conference, I am consenting to the following terms, by which I agree to uphold the Different Games Code of Conduct and do my part in promoting diversity in gaming communities:

  - I will do my best to recognize that this is a learning space for every participant.
  - I will give myself and those around me the space to learn.
  - I will address each individual by their pronouns.
  - I will ask before I take photos of people.
  - I will respect the wishes of people who do not want to be photographed or appear in photos.
  - I will listen to others with the intent of letting them share their perspectives and not interrupt my fellow Different Games participants.
  - I will remain respectful when called out.
  - I will not harass anyone.
  - If I am in a conflict with someone, I will attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully.
  - I will not use homophobic, cissexist, sexist, racist, ableist, or classist language. 
  - I acknowledge that I represent Different Games to the community hosting the conference and my behavior reflects upon Different Games Conference as a whole. I agree to hold myself accountable for my actions and speech.
  - I will acknowledge that my behavior reflects upon Different Games as a whole. I agree to hold ourselves accountable for our actions.


## Conflict Resolution
Should I find myself in a conflict, I will take the following steps in attempt to resolve the conflict:

  - Find an appropriate time to pull them aside to discuss their behavior. If I am not comfortable doing this, I will notify a staff member so they can address the situation.
  - Inform the person that what they have said or done is offensive and explain as best I can why.
  - Try to help them understand how to avoid it in the future.
  - Be open to forgiving the person for their mistake and helping them remain a part of our community.
  - If all else fails, ask a staff member to help mediate the situation.

If you see people behaving inappropriately, please bring it to the attention of one of our staff or volunteers and allow us to respond to the situation. Or if you find yourself in conflict and have attempted to resolve the conflict and received unsatisfactory resolution, seek our assistance for mediation or support. Allow us to handle conflict resolution for any circumstance that compromises Different Games as a safe space.

  - Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

  - Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other vulnerable people from intentional abuse
  - Publication of non-harassing private communication

  - ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
