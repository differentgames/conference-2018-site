    <h2 class="text-center">Introducing our 2016 Track Chairs</h2>
    <p>
This year, Different Games is thrilled to welcome 7 respected colleagues on board as our DG Track Chairs.
This group of artists, game designers and academics have proposed calls for content in areas of interest to the DG community and joined us in reviewing the 2018 submissions in their respective tracks.
We’re humbled to have them join us by volunteering their vision and expertise to help shape some of the content of this year’s event. 
    </p>

While <span class="cool">submissions were welcome on all topics related to inclusivity, diversity and other themes of interest to the DG community,</span> we’re pleased to announce the following DG Conference tracks and the chairs who will be presenting them:

This track offers forward-thinking looks into work being done in the procedural and system-driven design arena, rejecting purely human authorship to broaden the possibility space of games and the kinds of experiences they can offer. This track is particularly interested in game and system design explorations that work with non-human co-authors to create meaningfully unpredictable and surprising outcomes. How does your game define its possibility space? How do your players (mis)understand its limits and boundaries? What constitutes a meaningfully "different" outcome within your game's systems, and why? This track especially encourages submissions on game designs that critically explore real-world systems, society's rule-sets and laws, and/or alternative social possibilities.        </p>

This track is dedicated to making technically weird problems less daunting. Let's explore the freedom you can find in tooling - new programming languages based in inclusive patterns like knitting, interesting details about how to use C# in a less frustrating way, domain-specific languages that solve small problems really well. Submissions might discuss new/emerging tools, more inclusive uses of established tools, or discussing some current projects in relation to this track, with the goal of making the inner processes of how we construct interactive experiences more accessible.

      <div class="collapse" id="multiculturalism-in-games">
        <p>
This track explores different issues and themes related to multiculturalism in video games in terms of gameplay, industry, and culture. The centrality of multiculturalism in video games derives from the diversity of the population that designs, develops, and most importantly plays those games. This track welcomes talks and paper presentations that tackle topics that mirror diversity in VG and multiple views such as (but not limited to): identification, gender in video game play and/or industry, ideology and religion, values, race, multilingualism, family life and community, and arts. Those topics mainly represent the pillars that constitute many different cultures. The main purpose of this track is to investigate the “functionality” of the above-mentioned topics in video game industry, game play experience, and culture. Thus, the audiences are able to see and sense the impact of multiculturalism and diversity on video games and vice versa.

      <div class="collapse" id="craft-game-play">
        <p>
Games have much to learn from craft, and vice versa. Craft is collaborative, open-ended, creative, meditative, and often focus on visual aesthetic goals. Games can be competitive, strategic or luck-based, and focus on player engagement. This workshop aims to bring these communities closer together by looking at the similarities and differences between craft-play and game-play. We will focus on the lessons that can be learned from each community with a view towards being able to create new kinds of game and/or craft experiences. The {Craft|Game} Play workshop aims to bring together students, scholars, and practitioners interested in the intersection of crafting communities and practices, playful design, and computer science. We intend to host short lightning talks at the beginning of the workshop from practitioners and scholars, to share ideas that will seed a mini-game jam that explores the “different” kinds of games and interactive media that can be envisioned when starting from the values associated with crafting communities. As part of a larger and ongoing effort to build a network of scholars working at the intersection of crafts and games, we envision also using the workshop as an opportunity to identify collaboration opportunities between participants. Workshop applicants can submit abstracts on this special topic to participate in this structured session.

      <div class="collapse" id="virtual-mechanics">
        <p>
This track explores how to create games in new ways. Physical games can use mechanics from video games to become clearer, more engaging, and more streamlined. From creating alternative controllers which challenge and engage players to physical installations with clear directions, this track will give designers a toolkit to create games in the physical world. This focus opens up game making to a larger audience as it allows for varying learning styles to engage with the creation of games in physical spaces. Workshop applicants can submit abstracts on this special topic to participate in this structured session.

So Bad It’s Good [Special Arcade Track] – James Earl Cox III</h3></a>

Videogames are mired in a mythology of “good design.” Students are taught to include player feedback and juiciness. Developers often recreate the games they know and admire. Games end up categorized in bloated genres that they may not fit. Realistically, there is little separating innovation and bad design, and often it comes down to any given player’s interpretation of the work. Cuphead exhibits no boss damage feedback nor boss damage juiciness. Even though these are basic concepts when approaching the standard concept of “a good game,” Cuphead sold over a million copies without their inclusion. FTL is so far removed from the rogue-like genre that its creators refer to it as a “rogue-like-like.” Even so, it has more in common with Oregon Trail (an adventure-genre game) than the rogue-like genre. So why adhere to accepted genres? And with more people making games every day, why are we trying to stick to overpopulated genres? Why aren’t we sharing our experiments? All of this is to say... to heck with good design! To heck with good art and good code! It’s a broken set of ideals and we need to expand anyways. This track is for the bad; games that exhibit such bad design and bad code and bad art that the game is good. Show your "failed" experiments. This track celebrates the most anti-design digital messes creators have. Games that disobey all the rules and make our jaws drop. None of that micro-innovation nonsense, we’re talking about full-on broken design. This track is for embracing new ideas and unique concepts, even if they make for a “bad” game. Don’t forget, not so many years ago, Walking Simulators were mocked for their lack of mechanics, and yet Campo Santo (creators of Fire Watch) have just been acquired by Valve. We have the power to redefine what games can be and the power to expand our understanding of what “good games” are.        </p>
